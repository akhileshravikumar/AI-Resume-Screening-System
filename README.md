# AI Resume Screening System (End-to-End ML Project)

An end-to-end Machine Learning system that automatically evaluates how well a resume matches a given job description using NLP and supervised learning.  
The system exposes a REST API that returns a **match score**, **matching skills**, and **missing skills**, simulating a real-world Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
